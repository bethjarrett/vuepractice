		<!--
		//step 1: Run the code above!
		
		v-for="singular in plural"		
		
		You can also render loops using vue.js. The syntax used is a "foreach" style.
		plural must be defined somewhere. In our case it's as a data property
		singular is defined on the fly.
		
		
		ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING EXERCISE
		1. Add the next line through the console using app.scene.push() in the console
		2. Use v-if to style the text. Red if Macbeth is speaking, blue if Lady Macbeth
		3. The lines are separated by \n. Can you re-structure the data and logic so that the dialogue has many lines, each line separate?
